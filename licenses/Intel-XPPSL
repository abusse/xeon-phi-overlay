  IMPORTANT - READ BEFORE COPYING, INSTALLING OR USING.

DO NOT USE OR LOAD THIS INTEL SOFTWARE UNTIL YOU HAVE CAREFULLY READ THE
FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  BY LOADING OR USING THIS INTEL SOFTWARE, YOU
(“YOU” OR “LICENSEE”) AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS INTEL SOFTWARE LICENSE
AGREEMENT (THIS “AGREEMENT”).  IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO SO AGREE, DO NOT COPY,
INSTALL OR USE THIS INTEL SOFTWARE.  IF YOU ARE AN AGENT OR EMPLOYEE OF A LEGAL
ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH LEGAL
ENTITY TO THIS AGREEMENT.

In consideration of the mutual covenants contained in this Agreement, and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which You
and Intel acknowledge, and intending to be legally bound, the You and Intel
agree as follows:

1.  DEFINITIONS.  The following definitions apply in this Agreement:

  1.1 “Derivative Work” means a derivative work, as defined in 17 U.S.C. § 101,
  of the Software Source Code, that You developed.

  1.2 “Documentation” means the user manuals and other written materials that
  describe the Software, its operation and matters related to its use, that
  Intel provides in connection with, under, or subject to, this Agreement, and

  unmodified form as delivered by Intel to You and not modified or combined with
  anything else except as permitted under Section 2.1(A).  Licensed Patent
  Claims are only those claims that Intel can license without paying, or
  obtaining the consent of, a third party.

  1.6 “Object Code” means computer programming code in binary form suitable
  for machine execution by a processor without the intervening steps of
  interpretation or compilation.

  1.7 “Open Source Software” means

    (A) any software that requires as a condition of use, modification or
    distribution of the software that the software or other software
    incorporated into, derived from or distributed with that software:

      • be disclosed or distributed in Source Code;
      • be licensed by the user to third parties for the purpose of making or
        distributing derivative works; or
      • be redistributable at no charge.

    (B) Open Source Software includes, without limitation, software licensed or
    distributed under any of the following licenses or distribution models, or
    licenses or distribution models substantially similar to any of the

      • the Common Public License (CPL).

  1.8 “Software” means the computer program, in Object Code and Source Code,
  identified in Attachment A, and any updated or improved version of the program
  that Intel provides to You under this Agreement, if any, but does not include
  Open Source Software or any computer programming code that is subject to an
  agreement, obligation or license (whether or not accompanying the computer
  program) intended to supersede or override this Agreement.

  1.9 “Source Code” means a form in which a computer program’s logic is easily
  deduced by a human being with skill in the art, such as a printed listing of
  the program or a form from which a printed listing can be easily recognized.

  1.10 “Support” means any maintenance services, installation assistance,
  customized support, consulting, or similar assistance that Intel may consent
  to provide to You related to the Software or to facilitate Your productive use

2.  LICENSE

  2.1 Grant.  Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 2.2, Intel hereby
  grants You, during the term of this Agreement, a non-transferable,
  non-exclusive, non-sublicenseable, limited right and license:

    (A) under Intel’s copyrights, to:

      (1) reproduce a reasonable number of copies of all or any portion of the
        Software for Your internal use;

      (2) prepare Derivative Works of the Source Code if provided by Intel;
        provided that this license does not include the right to sublicense;

      (3) distribute the Software or modified versions of the Software only in
        Object Code, only under Intel’s EULA attached as Attachment B, and only
        for use with Intel Products; and

      (4) reproduce and distribute the Documentation as is reasonably necessary
        for You to exercise Your license rights under this Section 2.1; and

    (B) under Intel’s Licensed Patent Claims, to:

      (1) make copies of the Software internally only;
      (2) use the Source Code internally only;
      (3) offer to distribute, and distribute and support, but not sell, the
        Software under the license under Intel’s copyrights granted in Section
        2.1(A), but only under the terms of that license under Intel’s
        copyrights and not as a sale, and only for the purposes set forth in
        Section 2.1(A);
      (4) provided, however, that You may only distribute the Software under
        Intel’s EULA and only for use with Intel Products; and
      (5) provided, however, that the license under the Licensed Patent Claims
        does not and will not apply to any modifications to the Source Code
       (including Derivative Works), whether made by You or any third party,
       even if the modification and Derivative Works are permitted under 2.1(A).

    (C) Unless specifically set forth in this Section 2.1, Intel grants You no
    other license or right to any Intel patents, copyrights, mask works, trade
    secrets, or other intellectual property, expressly or by implication,
    estoppel, statute or otherwise.  Intel reserves all rights that it does not
    expressly grant to You in this Agreement.

  2.2 Restrictions.

    (A) All rights, title and interest in and to the Software and Documentation
    are and will remain the exclusive property of Intel.  Unless expressly
    permitted under Section 2.1(A), You will not, and will not allow any third
    party to:

      (1) use, copy or distribute the Software or Documentation;

      (2) modify, adapt, enhance, disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer,
        change or create Derivative Works from the Software; or

      (3) use the Software to process the data of, or make the Software
        available online for the use of, third parties.

    (B) The consideration under this Agreement is only for the licenses that
    Intel expressly grants to You in Section 2.1.  Any other rights including,
    but not limited to, additional patent rights, will require an additional
    license and additional consideration.  Nothing in this Agreement requires or
    will be treated to require Intel to grant any additional license.  You
    acknowledge that an essential basis of the bargain in this Agreement is
    that Intel grants You no licenses or other rights including, but not limited
    to, patent, copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or other
    intellectual property licenses or rights with respect to the Software and
    Documentation, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, except for the
    licenses expressly granted in Section 2.1.

    (C) Except as expressly permitted under Section 2.1, You will not allow the
    Software to be accessed or used by third parties.  Notwithstanding the
    foregoing, Your authorized consultants and subcontractors may access the
    Software where the access is incidental to their performing services on Your
    behalf consistent with the license granted to You under this Agreement,
    provided You bind those consultants and subcontractors to the
    confidentiality and other obligations imposed on You under this Agreement
    and You are fully liable to Intel for the actions and inaction of those
    consultants and subcontractors.

  2.3 Copies.  In addition to the number of copies permissible under Section
  2.1(A)(1), You may make a reasonable number of copies of the Software for
  archival purposes or for use as a back-up when the Software is not
  operational.  You must copy all copyright legends, trademarks, trade names and
  other legends and identification when You copy the Software and Documentation.
  You will maintain records of the number of copies currently in Your possession
  or control, and will provide copies of those records to Intel upon request.
  You will maintain records of the number of copies currently in Your possession
  or control, and the location of each copy of the Source Code and Derivative
  Works and will provide copies of those records to Intel upon request.

  2.4 Open Source Software.  If the Software includes Open Source Software, that
  Open Source Software is licensed under the applicable Open Source Software
  license agreement identified in the Open Source Software comments in the
  applicable source code file(s) and file header provided with the Software.
  Where applicable, the Documentation may contain additional detail.  With
  respect to the Open Source Software, nothing in this Agreement limits any
  rights under, or grants rights that supersede, the terms of the applicable
  Open Source Software license agreement.  You will not subject the Software or
  Documentation, in whole or in part, to any license obligations associated with
  Open Source Software, including combining the Software or Documentation with
  Open Source Software in a manner that subjects Intel, or any portion of the
  Software, to any license obligations of the Open Source Software.

3.  FEES; ROYALTIES; TAXES

  The license is granted under this Agreement for no fee or royalty.  Each party
  is responsible for its own tax liability arising out of this Agreement.

4.  TERM; TERMINATION

  4.1 Term.  The term of this Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and
  continue until terminated in accordance with this Section 4.

  4.2 Termination.  Intel may terminate this Agreement:

    • if You materially breach any other provision of this Agreement, and You
      fail to correct the breach within 30 days of Your receipt of written
      notice of that breach or, if the breach is incapable of cure within 30
      days, You fail to take substantial steps toward a cure within that period;

    • immediately, if You breach any provision of Sections 2 or 7; or

    • immediately, if You become insolvent or make an assignment for the benefit
      of creditors, or a trustee or receiver is appointed for You or for a
      substantial part of Your assets, or bankruptcy, reorganization or
      insolvency proceedings are instituted by or against You.

  4.3 Effect of Termination.

    (A) Expiration or termination of this Agreement will terminate Your license
    rights under this Agreement.

    (B) Within 30 days after expiration or termination of this Agreement, You
    will furnish Intel a written certification that You have either returned to
    Intel or destroyed the original and all copies, including partial copies, of
    the Software that Intel furnished under this Agreement or that You made as
    permitted by this Agreement, and that no copies or portions of the Software
    remain in Your possession or in the possession of Your employees or agents

    (C) Sections 2.1(C), 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3, 4.3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 will
    survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.

5.  OWNERSHIP

  5.1 Derivative Works.  You will own all copyrights in the Derivative Works.
  By this Agreement, You grant to Intel a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual,
  irrevocable, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable license to use, copy,
  sell, have sold, make, have made and import the Derivative Works in any manner
  and on any media Intel chooses; provided, however, You have no obligation to
  deliver the Derivative Works to Intel.

  5.2 Feedback.  To the extent You provide Intel with Feedback, You grant to
  Intel and Intel accepts, a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable,
  royalty-free, transferable license, with the right to sublicense, under Your
  intellectual property rights to the Feedback to incorporate or otherwise use
  Feedback as provided by You to Intel. “Feedback” means Your requirements,
  inputs, comments, responses, opinions, feedback and errata, whether oral or
  written, concerning the Software and Documentation and Your technical system
  requirements for Intel to include in the Software definition, design or
  validation.

6.  SUPPORT

  6.1 Services.  Intel has no obligation to maintain or support the Software or
  Documentation.  You are directed to access Intel’s webpage
  http://software.intel.com/en-us/ for basic FAQ’s and other Intel product
  resources relating to the Software.  Under no circumstances will Intel have
  any obligation to Your Customers with respect to maintenance or support of the
  Software.

  6.2 Additional Services.  Intel has no obligation to perform any maintenance
  or other services not specifically provided for in this Agreement.  However,
  if Intel agrees to perform services requested by You that are not included as
  part of this Agreement, Intel will bill You for those services at prices and
  on terms to be agreed by You and Intel.

7.  NO PUBLICITY

  7.1 No Publicity.  You may not use Intel’s name, or the names of any Intel
  employees, in any publication, advertisement or other announcement, without
  Intel’s prior written consent in each instance.

8.  INDEMNITY

  8.1 By You.

    (A) You will defend, at Your own expense, any legal action brought against
    Intel to the extent that it is based on an Indemnified Claim, which is any
    of the following claims or allegations:

      (1) that the Derivative Works, or any portion of the Derivative Works, in
        the form delivered to Intel, directly infringes on patents or copyrights
        or constitutes a misappropriation of trade secrets of any third party;
        or

      (2) arising from or relating to Your breach of any provision of this
        Agreement including, but not limited to, a breach of Section 2.

    (B) You will pay any costs and damages finally awarded against Intel that
    are attributable to any Indemnified Claim or that Intel incurs through
    settlement of an Indemnified Claim, but will not be responsible for any
    compromise that Intel makes or expense that Intel incurs without Your
    consent.  The defense and payments are subject to the condition that Intel
    gives You prompt written notice of the Indemnified Claim, allows You to
    direct the defense and settlement of the Indemnified Claim, and cooperates
    with You as necessary for defense and settlement of the Indemnified Claim.

9.  WARRANTY

  Disclaimer.  Intel makes no warranties to You with respect to the Software or
  any Support, service, advice, or assistance furnished under this Agreement,
  and no warranties of any kind, whether written, oral, implied or statutory,
  including warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose,
  non-infringement or arising from course of dealing or usage in trade will
  apply.

10.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

    (A) Intel’s cumulative liability to You for all claims of any kind resulting
      from Intel’s performance or breach of this Agreement or the Software
      furnished under this Agreement will not exceed the Fees actually received
      by Intel from You under this Agreement for the Software that is the
      subject of the claim or $1,000, if the Software was provided at no charge
      to You, regardless of whether Intel has been advised of the possibility of
      those damages or whether any remedy set forth in this Agreement fails of
      its essential purpose or otherwise.  This limitation of liability is
      cumulative and not per incident; the existence of more than one claim will
      not increase the limit.

    (B) Intel will not be liable for costs of procurement of substitutes, loss
      of profits, loss of use, interruption of business, or for any other
      special, consequential, punitive or incidental damages, however caused,
      whether for breach of warranty, contract, tort, negligence, strict
      liability or otherwise, irrespective of whether Intel has advance notice
      of the possibility of such damages.  The limitation of liability set forth
      in this Section 10 is a fundamental basis of this Agreement; and each
      Party understands and agrees that the other would not have entered into
      this Agreement without the limitation of liability.

11.  GENERAL PROVISIONS

  11.1 Notices.

    (A) All notices required or permitted to be given under this Agreement must
    be in writing, make reference to this Agreement, and be delivered by hand,
    or dispatched by prepaid air courier or by registered or certified airmail,
    postage prepaid, addressed as follows:

      If to Intel:

      Attn:  Cathie McCall FM3-78

    (B) Notices will be considered served when received by addressee or, if
    delivery is not accomplished by reason of some fault of the addressee, when
    tendered for delivery.  Either Party may give written notice of a change of
    address and, after notice of such change has been received, any notice or
    request will be given to that Party at the changed address.

  11.2 Audit Rights.  Upon reasonable advance notice, Intel will have the right
  to inspect, or have an independent auditor inspect, Your facilities and
  records during normal business hours to verify Your compliance with the terms
  and conditions of this Agreement.  If an inspection discloses that You are not
  compliant with these terms, Intel may exercise any or all rights and remedies
  provided under this Agreement or by law including, but not limited to, the
  right to recover the cost of the audit.

  11.3 Export.  The Software, Documentation and all related technical
  information or materials are subject to export controls and (are or may be)
  licensable under U.S.
  Government export regulations.  You will not export, re-export, divert,
  transfer or disclose, directly or indirectly, the Software, Documentation and
  any related technical information or materials without complying strictly with
  all legal requirements including, without limitation, obtaining the prior
  approval of the U.S. Department of Commerce and, if necessary, other agencies
  or departments of the U.S. Government.  Please access Intel’s website,
  http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/legal/export-compliance.html, for
  information regarding the export classification of the Software that may be
  necessary to assist Your compliance with this provision.  You will execute and
  deliver to Intel “Letters of Assurance” as may be required under applicable
  export regulations.  You will indemnify Intel against any loss related to Your
  failure to conform to these requirements.

  11.4 No Sublicensing, Assignment or Transfer.

    (A) You may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, or any of Your
    rights and obligations under this Agreement, and any attempt to do so will
    be void.  In addition, You may not sublicense, assign or transfer any
    Software, Documentation, Confidential Information or any part of the
    Software, Documentation or Confidential Information, or any right in this
    Agreement to any third party temporarily (such as loaning, rental, licensing
    or timeshare) or permanently, except as expressly permitted under Section
    2.1 or 2.2, without the prior written consent of Intel in each instance,
    which consent Intel may withhold in its sole discretion.  Any attempted
    sublicense, assignment or transfer that is not expressly permitted under
    Section 2 or is without consent will be void.

    (B) You agree that this Agreement binds You and each of Your affiliates and
    the employees, agents, representatives and persons associated with any of
    them.  Without limitation of the foregoing, if there is a sale of
    substantially all of Your assets, a merger, a re-organization, or a change
    in control of 50% or more of Your equity, no transfer or assignment
    (including, without limitation, an assignment by operation of law) of this
    Agreement may be made without the prior written consent of Intel.

  11.5 U.S. Government Contract Provisions.  This Agreement is for Your
  temporary license of Software.  No Government procurement regulation or
  contract clauses or provision will be considered a part of any transaction
  between You and Intel under this Agreement unless its inclusion is required by
  statute, or mutually agreed upon in writing by You and Intel in connection
  with a specific transaction.  The technical data and computer software covered
  by this license is a “Commercial Item,” as that term is defined by the FAR
  2.101 (48 C.F.R. 2.101) and is “commercial computer software” and “commercial
  computer software documentation” as specified under FAR 12.212(48 C.F.R.
  12.212) or DFARS 227.7202 (48 C.F.R. 227.7202), as applicable.  This
  commercial computer software and related documentation is provided to end
  users for use by and on behalf of the U.S. Government, with only those rights
  as are granted to all other end users under the terms and conditions in this
  Agreement.  Use for or on behalf of the U.S. Government is permitted only if
  the party acquiring or using this Software is properly authorized by an
  appropriate U.S. Government official.  This use by or for the U.S. Government
  clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFARS, or other provision
  that addresses Government rights in the computer Software or documentation
  covered by this license.  All copyright licenses granted to the
  U.S. Government are coextensive with the technical data and computer Software
  licenses granted in this Agreement.  The U.S. Government will only have the
  right to reproduce, distribute, perform, display, and prepare Derivative Works
  as needed to implement those rights.

  11.6 Force Majeure.  Except for Your obligations under Section 3, neither
  Party will be liable to the other Party for delay in performing its
  obligations, or failure to perform any obligations, under this Agreement, if
  the delay or failure results from circumstances beyond the control of that
  Party including, but not limited to, any acts of God, governmental act, fire,
  explosion, accident, war, armed conflict, terrorist act or civil commotion.
  If there is a delay, the time for performance will be extended by the amount
  of time lost by reason of the delay; provided, however, should an event of
  force majeure described in this Section delay either Party’s performance in
  any material respect for a period of more than 90 days, then the other Party
  will have the option, upon giving written notice, to terminate this Agreement
  or the relevant portion of this Agreement affected by the delay.

  11.7 Waiver and Severability.  If either Party fails to enforce at any time
  any of the provisions of this Agreement, or to exercise any election of
  options provided in this Agreement, that failure will not constitute a waiver
  of that provision or option, or affect the validity of this Agreement or any
  part of this Agreement, or the right of the waiving Party to enforce
  subsequently each and every provision.  If any provision of this Agreement is
  held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the Agreement will continue in
  full force and effect.

  11.8 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

    (A) The procedural and substantive laws of the State of Delaware, U.S.A.,
    without regard to its conflicts of laws principles, will govern this
    Agreement.  This Agreement is prepared and executed and will be interpreted
    in the English language only, and no translation of the Agreement into
    another language will have any effect.  You and Intel agree that the United
    Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (1980)
    is specifically excluded from and will not apply to this Agreement.

    (B) The state and federal courts located in the State of Delaware will have
    exclusive jurisdiction of all disputes and litigation arising out of or
    related to this Agreement including, without limitation, matters connected
    with its performance.  Each Party irrevocably submits to the personal
    jurisdiction of those courts and irrevocably waives all objections to such
    venue.

  11.9 Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, the Attachments, Exhibits, Appendix
  and Non Disclosure Agreement(s) contain the complete and exclusive statement
  of the agreement between You and Intel and supersede all proposals, oral or
  written, and all other communications between You and Intel relating to the
  subject matter of this Agreement.  Only a written instrument duly executed by
  authorized representatives of Intel and You may modify this Agreement.

  LICENSE.  You have a license under Intel’s copyrights to reproduce Intel’s
  Software in binary form, (with the accompanying documentation, the “Software”)
  for your organization’s internal use only in connection with Intel products
  for which the Software has been provided, subject to the following conditions:

  (a) You may not disclose, distribute or transfer any part of the Software
  except as provided in this Agreement, and you agree to prevent unauthorized
  copying of the Software.
  (b) You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software.

  with, an enclosed license.txt file or other text or file.
  (e) Intel has no obligation to provide any support, technical assistance or
  updates for the Software.

  NO IMPLIED LICENSES OR OTHER RIGHTS.  The consideration under this Agreement
  is only for the licenses that Intel expressly grants to You in the preceding
  paragraphs.  Any other rights including, but not limited to, patent rights,
  would require an additional license and additional consideration.  Nothing in
  this Agreement requires or will be treated to require Intel to grant any such
  additional license.  An essential basis of the bargain in this Agreement is
  that Intel grants You no licenses or other rights including, but not limited
  to, patent, copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or other
  intellectual property licenses or rights, by implication, estoppel or
  otherwise, except for the licenses expressly granted in the preceding
  paragraphs.

  OWNERSHIP OF SOFTWARE AND COPYRIGHTS.  Title to all copies of the Software
  remains with Intel or its suppliers.  The Software is copyrighted and
  protected by the laws of the United States and other countries, and
  international treaty provisions.  You may not remove any copyright notices
  from the Software.  Except as otherwise expressly provided above, Intel grants
  no express or implied right under Intel patents, copyrights, trademarks, or
  other intellectual property rights.  Transfer of the license terminates your
  right to use the Software.

  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  The Software is provided “AS IS” without warranty of

  OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  NEITHER INTEL NOR ITS SUPPLIERS WILL BE LIABLE FOR
  ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR INDIRECT,
  SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHETHER UNDER THIS
  AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF INTEL HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
  SUCH DAMAGES.

  LICENSE TO USE COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS.  This Agreement does NOT obligate You
  to provide Intel with comments or suggestions regarding the Software.
  However, if You provide Intel with comments or suggestions for the
  modification, correction, improvement or enhancement of (a) the Software or
  (b) Intel products or processes that work with the Software, you grant to
  Intel a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable,
  royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, under Your intellectual
  property rights, to incorporate or otherwise utilize those comments and
  suggestions.

  TERMINATION OF THIS LICENSE.  Intel or the sublicensor may terminate this
  license at any time if You are in breach of any of its terms or conditions.
  Upon termination, You will immediately destroy the Software, and return to
  Intel all copies of the Software.

  THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY.  Intel is an intended beneficiary of this EULA and
  has the right to enforce all of its terms.

  U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS.  No Government procurement regulation or
  contract clauses or provision will be considered a part of any transaction
  related to this EULA unless its inclusion is required by statute, or mutually
  agreed upon in writing by the Parties in connection with a specific
  transaction.  The technical data and computer software covered by this license
  is a “Commercial Item,” as that term is defined by the FAR 2.101 (48 C.F.R.
