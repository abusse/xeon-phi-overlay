    The memkind library is an user extensible heap manager built on top of
    jemalloc which enables control of memory characteristics and a
    partitioning of the heap between kinds of memory. The kinds of memory
    are defined by operating system memory policies that have been applied
    to virtual address ranges. Memory characteristics supported by
    memkind without user extension include control of NUMA and page size
    features. The jemalloc non-standard interface has been extended to
    enable specialized arenas to make requests for virtual memory from the
    operating system through the memkind partition interface. Through the
    other memkind interfaces the user can control and extend memory
    partition features and allocate memory while selecting enabled
    features. This software is being made available for early evaluation.
    Feedback on design or implementation is greatly appreciated.
